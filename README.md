# Pokédex CLI - Educational TypeScript Project

A command-line interface (CLI) Pokémon application built with TypeScript that demonstrates modern JavaScript/TypeScript development practices, API integration, caching, and interactive command-line programming.

## Educational Goals

This project serves as a learning tool for:
- **TypeScript Development**: Modern ES modules, strict typing, and TypeScript best practices
- **CLI Development**: Building interactive command-line applications with Node.js
- **API Integration**: Working with external APIs (PokéAPI) and handling async operations
- **Caching Strategies**: Implementing intelligent caching to reduce API calls
- **State Management**: Managing application state in a CLI environment
- **Testing**: Unit testing with Vitest
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user feedback

## Features

- **Interactive CLI**: Command-line interface with REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
- **Pokémon Data**: Browse locations, explore areas, and view Pokémon information
- **Catching System**: Try to catch Pokémon with a simple probability system
- **Pokédex Management**: View your caught Pokémon collection
- **Intelligent Caching**: Reduces API calls with configurable cache intervals
- **Pagination**: Navigate through location lists with `map` and `mapb` commands
